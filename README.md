# 🔥 Land8Fire: A Complete Study on Wildfire Segmentation through Comprehensive Review, Human-Annotated Multispectral Dataset, and Extensive Benchmarking

Land8Fire focuses on wildfire detection using high-resolution satellite imagery. Within this project, we offer Land8Fire dataset, a large-scale and high-resolution wildfire segmentation dataset designed to advance research in remote sensing-based fire detection. Alongside the dataset, this repository includes the full pipeline for preprocessing, k-fold generation, and reproducible analysis used in our study.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UARK-AICV/Land8Fire.git
   cd Land8Fire
   ```

2. (Optional) Create Virtual Environment
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```

3. Install Dependencies
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## 📦 Dataset


The Land8Fire dataset is stored on Google Drive and organized as follows:
```
Land8Fire/
├── images/
├── masks/
└── kfolds/
    ├── kfold1/
    │   ├── images.zip
    │   └── masks.zip
    ├── kfold2/
    │   ├── images.zip
    │   └── masks.zip
    ...
    └── kfold5/
        ├── images.zip
        └── masks.zip
```



## 📁 Benchmarking
Our code is implemented on mmsegmentation and its update is rapid. Please keep in mind you're using the same/compatibility version. Please refer to get_started for installation and dataset_prepare for dataset preparation on mmsegmentation.
